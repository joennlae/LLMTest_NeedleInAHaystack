While it's true that matter behaves in a predictable way, the feeling of being able to choose what you do can be reconciled with this by acknowledging that there are certain limits to our control over our desires and actions. While we can't control our initial wants, we can exert some influence over what we want to want, and we can certainly control our actions to some extent. The idea of higher-order desires, as mentioned in the text, is one way to think about this.
