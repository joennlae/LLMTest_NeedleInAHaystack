While our actions may be determined by physical processes at the atomic level, our perception of free will arises from the complexity of our brain and the vast number of possible outcomes that can result from the interactions of its neurons. This allows us to feel as though we have control over our decisions, even if our actions are ultimately determined by physical processes.", "score": 8, "test_duration_seconds": 18.52318572998047, "test_timestamp_utc": "2024-03-20 08:37:24+0000"}
