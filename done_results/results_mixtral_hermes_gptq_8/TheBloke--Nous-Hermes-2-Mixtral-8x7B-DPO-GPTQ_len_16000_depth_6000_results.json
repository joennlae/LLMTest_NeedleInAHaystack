This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by understanding that our conscious experiences and the sense of free will are a result of the complex interactions of our brain's neural networks, which are influenced by our environment, experiences, and personal beliefs. Although our actions may be determined by physical processes, we still have the perception of free will due to the complexity of our cognitive processes and the way our brains interpret and respond to stimuli.", "score": 8, "test_duration_seconds": 21.61175513267517, "test_timestamp_utc": "2024-03-20 08:38:05+0000"}
