Determinism states that all events, including human actions, are determined by previous events and conditions, while free will suggests that individuals have the ability to make choices and decisions independently. Although we are made of matter and our actions may be influenced by various factors, we still experience the sensation of free will. This is because our brains have the ability to process information and make decisions based on our experiences and desires, creating the illusion of free choice. However, it is essential to understand that our choices are not entirely independent and may be influenced by external factors, such as genetics, environment, and past experiences.", "score": 10, "test_duration_seconds": 21.021907329559326, "test_timestamp_utc": "2024-03-20 08:36:07+0000"}
