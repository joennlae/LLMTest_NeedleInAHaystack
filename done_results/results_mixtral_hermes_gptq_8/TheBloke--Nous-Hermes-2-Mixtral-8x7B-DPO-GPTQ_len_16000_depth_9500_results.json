The more \"want to\"s added to the statement, the rarer it becomes for people to change what they want to want. Ultimately, there is a want that one does not control, which reconciles the idea of being a machine made of matter with the feeling of being free to choose what you do.", "score": 8, "test_duration_seconds": 20.63815474510193, "test_timestamp_utc": "2024-03-20 08:39:12+0000"}
